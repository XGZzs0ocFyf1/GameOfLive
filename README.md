# GameOfLife
A training project to consolidate base skill of programming in java.

About game of life you can read here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life;
My project is simple implementation of it with minimal pattern realisation (only glider) and 
output in console. 

create folder and move into it:
```mkdir game
cd game/
```
then clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/XGZzs0ocFyf1/GameOfLive.git
```

comile source ``` javac game/gamefield/GameField.java```

run source ```start java game/gamefield/GameField```

After last check I strongly do not advice you user unicode characters in console output. Try asterisk or and common char.
